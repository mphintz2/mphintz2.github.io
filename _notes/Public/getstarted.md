# Goals of the Campaign
Expect to explore Arkaedia, find secrets, and roleplay encounters with NPCs. A lot of the gameplay will surround each player's stated aims for his or her character.
There will be combat too (and plenty of it), but it may prove beneficial to be selective about when, where, and how you pick fights. I offer no guarantee of "balanced" combats. It is for you to assess whether your characters can handle a given situation or not and for you to bear the consequences. The wild lands of Arkaedia are dangerous, after all!  
That said, I am not trying to kill your characters. I am as interested in exploring and developing your characters as you are. I am their biggest fan.
## Character Progression
Characters will progress based on experience rewarded, as per the books. Experience will be rewarded for the following:
- Vanquishing Foes
- Exploration and Discovery
	- Exploring areas on the map
	- Finding a significant item, location, or NPC
- Roleplaying
	- Advancing a PC story
## Character Creation
To emphasize danger of an unknown, uncharted wilderness and a slow crawl to mastery of it, we are starting at level 1. Progression will be experience-based and likely fairly slow.
### Stats
Use the core point-buy system, but start with 33 points rather than 27. That way you can get a 16 or 17 in a stat to start, but each of those "points" will cost you 3.
For example, you could have 16, 14, 14, 12, 10, 8 OR 17, 17, 11, 8, 8, 8.

## Starting Out in Arkaedia
Arkaedia is a remote region located some distance from each of the three nations. Nestled between two mountain regions, its winters can be harsh and its summers severe.  
Multiple factors have kept the three nations at bay for generations: the severe weather, its general geographic seclusion, its proximity to two mysterious protective domes, not to mention the years of warring with orcs in the [[Hordelands]]. Now in the year 553 TA, the three nations are finally beginning to explore Arkaedia and vie for control of the region.
Currently, it is Late Summer in Arkaedia. Your characters have arrived at the frontier town of [[Mournstead]] along the banks of the Mourning Star River.
