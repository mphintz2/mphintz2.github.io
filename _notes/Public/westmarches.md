# What's "West Marches"?
West Marches is a style of D&D game intended to solve scheduling issues (sounds familiar, right?). There are a few main tenants of West Marches, which you should know about because they may factor into this campaign:  
- Adventures (i.e. sessions) are assumed to begin and end in a safe area (most likely always "town")  
- Part of your task as an adventurer is exploring an uncharted land  
- It is not required that all players be present for any individual adventure  
- Generally, adventures will be driven by players and their characters' collective desires
