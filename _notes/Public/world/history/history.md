# History
---
Approximately 1000 years ago, the arcane arts were harnessed into what is now known as wizardry, effectively sharing arcane magic with a larger population. Gradually, over the centuries that following wizardry's inception, the number of people who could access (or benefit from) arcane magic grew. Likewise over the same period, the merits of martial warfare waned. Old armies were defeated and new nations emerged.
## The Novum Empire
---
One empire stands out in the annals of history. That empire, remembered by modern scholars as the [[Novum Empire]], assembled a ruling consortium of mages. Together, these mages began an unprecedented rise to power, glory, and wealth.  
The inventions and discoveries that originate in the time of the [[Novum Empire]] are too many to list here: labor-assisting magic, transportation magic, healing magic, etc. In short, all schools of magic were developed and expanded during Novum's reign. It was, truly, the "Golden Age of Wizardry."
## The Wizarding Wars
---
What rises must fall, however, and Novum was no different. A series of wars erupted and spread quickly, leading to mass destruction, chaos, and death.  
Modern historians debate the exact nature of Novum's downfall, but a few things are certain (or at least widely accepted):
1. A series of magical protective domes appeared throughout the landscape. This is considered now to have marked a new era that is referred as Testudines Apperum or TA. Some claim that more of these domes existed in the past, but only two domes remain in present day, known as the [[Testudines Majorus]] and [[Testudines Minorus]]. As all attempts at penetrating these domes have failed, no one knows what exists beyond their borders.
2. Following the appearance of the domes, new and horrific war machines emerged, changing yet again the nature of warfare. In the years following the appearance of the domes, most areas not protected by them were leveled.
3. What wasn't destroyed by these new war machines was eventually claimed by a variety of maladies: relentless hordes of orcs, armed to the teeth; virulent plagues spreading across the land; dark, unspeakable horrors summoned by the blackest of magic; and more.
## The Dark Age
---
A centuries-long "Dark Age" followed the Empire's downfall. During this time, humans had a rough go of it: plagues from the Wizarding wars continued to spread, killing many; rulers began to enforce strict use of binding enchantment magic, which severally limited their citizens' freedoms and forced many into servitude and slavery; and finally, orcs continued to emerge regularly from the [[Testudines Majorus]] into a wide land called the [[Hordelands]].
## The Orc Wars
---
This final threat proved the most dire and prevented any forward progress. [[Bezie]] bore the brunt of the orc attacks and served valiantly as civilization's primary defenders throughout the Dark Age. It was only after the other two nations helped that the orcs were finally beaten back.
## Present Era
---
It has only been a few human generations (roughly 80 years) since the relentless horde of orcs ceased. In the decades of peace that followed the Orc Wars, the three nations have prospered and expanded rapidly, beginning to shine their lights upon the darkness that followed Novum's fall, including into its remotest regions.
