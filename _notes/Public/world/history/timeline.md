## Primordial - 20,000-10,000 years ago
--------
[[Isoqqua]] still ruled the land as it was forming from a shapeless mass.
## Primal - 10,000-5,000 years ago
-----------
[[Khayima]] came to power and her druids built the first vestiges of civilization.
## Prehistoric - 5,000-2,000 years ago
-------
[[The Plowmender]] gave humans animal husbandry and seeds to sow and they settled down into semi-permanent farming communities.
## Ancient - 2,000-1,000 years ago
--------
As the strength and reach of farming communities grew, so too did their thirst for more land. And thus, mass-scale war began. The latter years of this era were marked by martial brutality and wanton bloodshed.
## Wizarding Era - 1,000-600 years ago
----------
As humans discovered and mastered arcane magic, the merits of martial warfare and its dangers waned. In a comparatively rapid fashion, wizardry was mastered by many, such that, by the end of this period, power had condensed into several hundred powerful human wizards who possessed power to rival gods.
## Wizarding Peak - 600-553 years ago
------
Wizarding power reached a height unimagined and prosperity reigned for a brief period of decades (approximately half a human life). Eventually, this power condensed further until it was in the hands of only a few powerful orders. These wizarding orders began to fight across the continent, which resulted in a new wave of war, death, and chaos unlike any the world had ever seen before.
## The Downfall / Testudines Apparum (TA) - 553 years ago
-------
Eventually, enough damage had been done to the centers of civilization that no single group could claim to rule the whole of the continent. A series of mysterious domes emerged throughout the landscape, through which no one could pass. This effectively blocked regions from others permanently, ending centuries-long trade dependences. Civilization descended further into chaos and unrest and people began to focus on local survival.
The year these domes emerged is marked as a new era and time is recorded from thence as Year TA. For example, ten years after the appearance of the domes would be 10 TA.
## Darkness - past 500 years

## Current Era - now
