# Magic
## Types of Magic
- Nature: Ancient magic of the world that only certain souls can touch and even fewer can harness
- Sorcery: Ancient magic that remains mostly unexplained and feared accordingly
- Wizardry: Old magic shared in texts from ages past that require strong minds to discern and make use of
- Warlockry: Derived from a pact with a more powerful being, inherently subservient, regarded as weak by almost all other magic users
- Divine: Relatively new magic, more available to the masses and seen as a common means of advancing in society

[[Magic Weapons]] are imbued, typically, with souls of [[Magic Creatures]].
