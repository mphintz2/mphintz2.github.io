# Religion
---
Religion is an important part of life for humans living in the three nations. The deities that rebuilt civilization, collectively known as "The Eight," established organizations (or human leaders of said organizations established them). Although some believe The Eight once walked the earth, no one knows who or where any of them may be now.
Other deities, though rumored to exist, are mostly forgotten and often believed to be little more than tales to scare children, at least in the most urbane and cultured centers of the world. In remote regions, those old deities may retain a fraction of power they once had.
## The Eight
---
Eight deities make up structured (and unstructured, as certain cases be) human religion:
### Ajantis
---
*Lord Protector, Vigilant Watcher, Eternal Guardian, The Silver Twin*
Ajantis is the vigilant watcher. He lives to guard his selected wards from all threats, and his clergy is expected to do the same. Although all his clergy agree about this duty, there is a split between the means for accomplishing that goal. Some claim that defense is the route; these groups build massive defensive fortifications and focus on security and protection. Other orders claim offense is at least as important and develop and practice advanced war tactics, as well. It is widely believed that Ajantis and Oxxifer were married, although the present state of their union is debated.
### Kubernitia
---
*Lady of Laws, The Unifying Mandate*  
Kubernitia is widely regarded as a regal and graceful queen, who both makes laws and ensures existing laws are enforced. She outsources some of the enforcement duties to other deities and their clergymembers, but insists on making the laws herself. As such, her clergymembers and institutions are among the most prestigious and powerful. 
### Couvalia
---
*Lady Goldheart, The Soft-Petaled Rose, Lifegiver, The Gold Twin*  
Couvalia and her clergy aim to be sources of joy in the world. She is typically depicted as a young, beautiful woman and represents both youth and fertility, as well as creativity, love, and passion. She is also regarded as fickle, shallow, and unfocused. Her clergy are somewhat disorganized, at least compared to some of the more orderly deities, but their devotion to the finer aspects of life never goes unappreciated.
### Darminov
---
*He of the Doomed Veil, Lord of the End of Everything, He Who Taketh, Death Himself, The Pitiless One, The Silent One*  
Darminov is a sullen, silent, and miserly god. His followers, few in number, typically do not speak (or speak little, if they must). As he is seen as the 
### Enoth
---
*The Whistling Fool, The Lord of Luck, The Great Soul, He Who Hath, The Layabout*  
Enoth is a wanderer who can never be pinned down. His clergy, among the most disorganized, typically value personal discovery, which can take two very different paths: some of his followers pursue hedonism as an ideal, while others claim ascetism is better. Either way, his clergymembers are among the most exotic and enigmatic in the land.
### Oxxifer
---
*Merchant's Friend, Queen of Commerce, The Smiling Queen, She Who Giveth*  
Oxxifer is and always has been the queen of commerce, able to bring disparate parties to a bargaining table and sell whatever products were up for sale. Her clergymembers are as much merchants as they are clerics of her faith and the lines between the two blur. Next to Kubernitia, her clergymembers are probably among the most powerful in the current regimes of the world, especially Olenda. It is widely believed that she and Ajantis were married at one point, but there is disagreement as to the present state of their union.
### Gia-Petrya
---
*Lady of Pain, The Great Misfortune, Lady Doom, The Midnight Fury*  
Gia-Petrya is a deity of hatred, fury, and pain. She has never been well understood, perhaps because she has always been feared. What people believe of her (and by extension, her clergy) is that she pursues wanton destruction and pain. However, there is an aspect of her that exists beneath the surface that only her followers discover (or so they claim). She is even less worshipped than Darminov, although a number of orders do pay her homage.
### Quizmire
---
*Lord of Glyphs and Portals, The High Artificer*  
Quizmire is the perpetual builder. He lives to create new things. He loves to make something where once nothing was, to conjure wealth from pure natural resources. For this reason, he has always rankled other deities and many long-standing human sensibilities. He has no real regard for nature "as it is." Everything is waiting for him to make it perfect (or someone of equal merit and means).
## Orders of the Eight
---
Although there are eight deities, humans naturally worship them in different ways--and in different combinations. Following is a rough presentation of some of the prominent orders (although more certainly exist, whether secretive or unknown for some other reason). More details or orders can be fleshed out as necessary.

## The Old Gods
---
Tales of gods that predate the Eight still exist, but as far as most people are concerned, the old gods are either fairy tales and never existed or have abandoned the world altogether. Still, the tales of their exploits and merits and flaws are bountiful, so many people still wonder and pay them respect.
Note: To be clear, there is no proof that the following deities exist, including being able to give people in the world their divine powers. While your character can give a nod of respect to one or multiple of the "old gods" or even worship one of them, none of the following deities are capable of providing magical power (i.e. as to a paladin or cleric).
### Isoqqua
---
*Elemental Lord*

### Khayima
---
*Earthmother, Queen of Animals*

### Lunea
---
*The Moonmaiden*

### Noctua
---
*Dark Goddess, Mistress of the Night*

### The Plowmender
---
*The Farmfather, Keeper of the Seeds*

### The Weaver
---
*Weaver of Fates, Lady Widow, The Webweaver*

## The New Agers
---
New agers do not worship deities, per se; rather, they are followers of a more esoteric nature, with things like chakras, meditation, and spiritualism being the focus. Although clerical power never derives from this type of worship, many monks and druids can derive power from focusing their energies in such a manner.
